| **Sectors** | **Intended policy-based actions** |
| --- | --- |
| Agriculture | Increase irrigation at smallholder level; Increase land under irrigation through Greenbelt initiative from 20,000 to 40,0000 ha; Expanded programme of Greenbelt initiative from 40,000 ha to 100000 ha by 2030; Build adaptation capacity in climate resilient agronomic practices for smallholder farmers; Promote on-farm water conservation technologies; Support an expanded programme of constructing multipurpose dams for irrigation and aquaculture; Develop financial mechanisms to support crop insurance targeting smallholder farmers; Promote the growing of drought tolerant crop varieties; Implement conservation agriculture and agroforestry practices; Promote improved land use practices|
|Water | Implement integrated catchment conservation and management programme; Promote water harvesting technologies at all levels; support an expanded programme of constructing multipurpose dams to enhance water storage; Support the revision of water related policies and strategies (inc. water SWAP); Develop and enhance climate information and early warning systems|
|Human health | Build capacity to diagnose, prevent and control climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria, diarrhea and malnutrition; Enhance public awareness about water, sanitation and hygiene practices and enhance health surveillance; Support expanded programme for preventing and controlling climate-sensitive diseases; Construct more health centres in order to improve access to health facilities within a walking distance of 8 km; Support the establishment of centre of excellence for research and disease control targeting climate-sensitive diseases|
|Energy | Promote use of biomass briquettes as substitute for firewood and charcoal; Promote an energy mix that moves people away from use of biomass; Support an expanded programme of briquette production and use; Construct storage dams for hydropower generation; Promote solar PV and use of the energy efficient bulbs; Promote use of bio-fuels for lighting and cooking replacing fossil-based fuel|
|Forestry | Support research in drought tolerant and fast-growing tree species; Expand afforestation and forest regeneration programmes; Promote growing of drought to tolerant and fast-growing tree species; Wildlife; Provide watering points at strategic locations of national park/game reserve; Implement diseases control programmes; Support capacity building in a wildlife institution to lead in adaptation initiatives e.g. translocation and culling|
|Fisheries | Capacity building in aquaculture and cage culture fish farming practices; Adopt ecosystem services approach in the management of fisheries resources; Promote aquaculture and cage culture fish farming practices; Protect fish spawning/breeding sites; Maintain fingerlings for stocking lakes and rivers after severe drought episodes| 
|Gender (and vulnerable groups)	| Promote gender mainstreaming in policies, programmes and projects; Support capacity building programmes for vulnerable groups|
|Infrastructure | Construct infrastructure for flood control, transport etc; Develop and implement climate related building codes/standards; Revise existing building standards in line with climate change |
|Industry |Promote research in industrial technologies|
